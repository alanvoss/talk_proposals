# Mastering Regular Expressions from a Perl Guy

## Track?

Beyond Ruby (because this isn't really limited to Ruby) or Fundamentals

## Abstract

Ever cared to know what is happening behind-the-scenes with your
regular expression engine, or how you can make your expressions
better?

## Description

Do you think regular expressions are black magic?  Have you ever
considered making them a larger part of your Ruby tool belt?  Do you
do a lot of string manipulation?  Any developer with beginning to
intermediate regular expression knowledge would likely benefit in
knowing how it all works, how you can improve your expressions to be
more readable and predictable, and how you can have fun by exploring
this (not so ancient) art.

In this discussion, I'll show you the basics of how a regular
expression engine functions, when to use it (and as importantly, when
not to do so), and some tricks you can employ (hopefully mostly
non-production ones) to get things finished quickly.

I'll also show some differences between how Perl's regex engine does
things (the predominant language I used prior to Ruby) and how Ruby's
does them differently.
