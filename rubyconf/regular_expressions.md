# Mastering Regular Expressions from a Perl Guy

## Track?

Beyond Ruby (because this isn't really limited to Ruby) or Fundamentals

## Abstract

Ever cared to know what is happening behind-the-scenes with your
regular expression engine, or how you can make your expressions
better?

## Description

Do you think regular expressions are black magic?  Have you ever
considered making them a larger part of your Ruby (or Vim, Javascript, etc.)
tool belt?  Do you do a lot of string manipulation?

Any developer with beginning to intermediate regular expression knowledge
would likely benefit in knowing how it all works, how you can improve your
expressions to be more readable and predictable, and how you can have fun
by exploring this (not so ancient) art.

In this discussion, I'll show you the basics of how a regular expression engine
generally functions, when to use it (and as importantly, when not to do so), and
some tricks you can employ (hopefully mostly non-production ones) to get thing
finished quickly.
