# Real Time Poker Equity

## Abstract

Poker is a game that fascinates me, and the invention of hole card cameras really changed the game forever.  One way it changed was the ability to track in real time the odds of each opponent winning for the benefit of the television audience.  Wouldn't it be fun to make such a thing yourself?

## In Two Sentences

Have you ever wondered how poker equity calculators are able to calculate very large numbers of combinations in (close to) real time?  Let's dive in.

## Target Audience

Beginner to intermediate in elixir.  This is more breaking down a problem than discussing a particular implementation.

## Length of Talk

20 or 40 minutes

## Given Talk Before?

No

## Other Presentation Experience

I have given many talks at local meetups (Perl, Ruby, and Elixir), but I have yet to speak at a national conference, and I welcome the opportunity.
