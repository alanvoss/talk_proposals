# Slacking Automatically

## Abstract

Chatops and chat bots are both fun to use and make. Recently, I was asked to make a bot for our company to manage our merge queue. The documentation for Slackbots can be hard to wade through. This talk will discuss the basic mechanics, options available, and how I did it with an Elixir backend.

## In Two Sentences

## Given Talk Before?

I have given it at a local company tech talk, and at a local Elixir meetup.

I have given many talks at local meetups (Perl, Ruby, and Elixir), but I have yet to speak at a national conference, and I welcome the opportunity.
