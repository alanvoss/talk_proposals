# Better Testing with Bypass

## Abstract

In a computing age where microservices are the norm, and calling
external services during testing would either be a production-only
activity or would slow down testing because latency would become
your new bottleneck, how about using a stand-in local server that
will not only properly handle your responses, but will also verify
routes are called the appropriate number of times.  Bypass is just
such a solution.


## In Two Sentences

Are you sick of having to mock a fuction that performs an external
request?  Are you comfortable that some of your code isn't tested?

## Target Audience

Intermediate users of Elixir who've struggled with various mocking
strategies.

## Length of Talk

20 or 40 minutes

## Given Talk Before?

No.

## Other Presentation Experience

I have given many talks at local meetups (Perl, Ruby, and Elixir),
but I have yet to speak at a national conference, and I welcome
the opportunity.
