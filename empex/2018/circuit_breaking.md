# Dealing with a Blown Fuse

## Abstract

Circuit breaking is a great way to handle conditions where external services are down. Integrating them with your application will likely help you think about which services are mandatory to return a sane response, and which can be viewed more as optional. As an added benefit, using them helps the foreign service owner recover more gracefully, as they won't be pounded immediately upon startup by your application or service.

## In Two Sentences

Circuit breakers can help take your application to a new level of resiliency in the face of external failures. What are they?

## Target Audience

Beginner to intermediate with little exposure to gracefully handing external service dependency failure conditions.

## Length of Talk

20 minutes.

## Given Talk Before?

## Other Presentation Experience

I have given many talks at local meetups (Perl, Ruby, and Elixir), but I have yet to speak at a national conference, and I welcome the opportunity.
